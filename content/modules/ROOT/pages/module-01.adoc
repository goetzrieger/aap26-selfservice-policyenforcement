== AAP Installation on OpenShift

To get started we need an Ansible Automation Platform 2.6 instance, so why not quickly deploy one on OpenShift. This is an easy task since it's done via an Operator:

* Log in to Openshift as cluster-admin 
* Install the Ansible Automation Platform Operator, leave all settings on default
* Wait until the Operator installation has finished
* Go to **Installed Operators** and click the **Ansible Automation Platform** Operator

You are now ready to install an instance of AAP. As you can see the Operator provides a good number of APIs you can use to manage a lot of the aspects of AAP.
The easiest way is to create an instance of the tile **Ansible Automation Platform**, this deploys the complete platform (Automation Controller, Automation-Hub and EDA).

* On the tile, click **Create instance**
* To get full control of the process, switch from **Form view** to **YAML view**
* In this YAML snippet replace `<read-write-many-storage-class>` with the RWX storage class `ocs-external-storagecluster-cephfs`, then replace the **spec** section with this content:

```
spec:
  database:
    resource_requirements:
      requests:
        cpu: 200m
        memory: 512Mi
    storage_requirements:
      requests:
        storage: 100Gi

  controller:
    disabled: false

  eda:
    disabled: false

  hub:
    disabled: false
    storage_type: file
    file_storage_storage_class: <read-write-many-storage-class>
    file_storage_size: 10Gi
```
Now wait until the AAP instance has been deployed by the Operator. After all ressources have been deployed, look up the Automation Controller URL and access it.

Get the admin password from the OpenShift secret:
* In the OpenShift UI, make sure you are in **Project** `AAP`, then go to **Workloads->Secrets** and copy the password from the secret `<instance name>-admin-password`.
* Login to the AAP UI as user `admin` and the password you extracted from the secret.

You should now see the dialog in AAP asking for a subscription, you can supply it either by a Subscription Manifest provided by your facilitator or by logging into your Red Hat account that must contain an AAP subscription. 
After providing an AAP Subscription you should be greeted with a shiny new AAP 2.6 UI!
